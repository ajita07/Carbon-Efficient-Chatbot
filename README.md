# 🌱 Carbon-Efficient AI Chatbot

A Flask-based chatbot that demonstrates how AI can be both powerful and environmentally responsible by leveraging energy-efficient hardware and real-time carbon tracking.

## 🌍 Why This Project Matters

Traditional AI models running on GPUs consume substantial energy, contributing significantly to carbon emissions. As AI usage grows exponentially, the environmental impact becomes increasingly concerning. This project addresses this critical issue by implementing a sustainable approach to AI interactions.

## ⚡ How It Achieves Carbon Efficiency

**This chatbot is carbon-efficient through three key innovations:**

1. **Groq's LPU Inference Engine**: Instead of energy-intensive GPUs, we use Groq's Language Processing Units specifically designed for high-speed, low-power AI processing, reducing energy consumption by up to 10x compared to traditional hardware.

2. **Real-time Carbon Tracking**: Integrated CodeCarbon monitoring provides instant emissions data for each query, creating transparency and awareness about AI's environmental impact.

3. **Optimized Architecture**: The serverless Flask deployment minimizes resource waste through efficient request handling and automatic scaling.

## 📊 Environmental Impact

- **Faster Responses**: Groq processes queries 10x faster than conventional systems
- **Lower Energy Use**: LPU architecture consumes significantly less power per inference
- **Carbon Awareness**: Real-time tracking encourages mindful AI usage
- **Sustainable Practices**: Sets a benchmark for eco-friendly AI development

## 🚀 Key Features

- 💬 AI-powered conversations using Groq's API
- 🌱 Real-time carbon emission tracking
- 📈 Emissions visualization for each query
- ⚡ High-speed, low-latency responses
- 🌍 Environmentally conscious architecture

## 🏗️ Technology Stack

- **Backend**: Flask, Python
- **AI Engine**: Groq LPU Inference
- **Carbon Tracking**: CodeCarbon
- **Deployment**: Render (auto-scaling)
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript

## 📈 The Bigger Picture

This project demonstrates that AI advancement and environmental sustainability can coexist. By making carbon efficiency a core feature rather than an afterthought, we're paving the way for greener AI technologies that don't compromise on performance while significantly reducing their ecological footprint.
